The following is a list of features I plan to add to FireHOL,
assuming that my time permits and there is demand for them.

The list appears in no particular order.

* NAT support, including port redirections and load balancing
  per firehol element. Today there is some limited support for
  masquerading and of course you can embed normal iptables
  NAT rules within firehol.conf. However, today these are just
  work-arounds since there is no connection between a firehol
  rule and the NAT system.

* Bandwidth shaping support per firehol element.

Ideally both the above should be "embedded" in firehol.conf rules
with something like:

interface eth0 internet maxbw 1Mbps queue-type htb
	server smtp accept	\
		maxbw 128kbps	\
		priority low 	\
		dnat mailhost.domain.com
		
	server http accept	\
		maxbw all	\
		priority med	\
		dnat "1.1.1.1 2.2.2.2" # this is load balancing
	
	client ssh accept priority hi

Nice, eh? I guess the only way to implement this is by making heavy use of the
MANGLE table and MARKing uniquely each FireHOL rule. This will allow all
iptables tables (mangle, nat, filter) and iproute to share the same traffic
categorization (through the MARK id on each packet). Some research has to be
done to find out if this is possible.

(note for me: possibly a banch of MARK numbers should be allocated to each
firehol rule so that individual iptables rules within one firehol rule can
have different actions - accept, drop, reject, etc).


* Bandwidth acounting support per firehol element, possibly with
  graphs.
  To implement this, a way must be found to uniquely identify each firehol
  rule. Possibly the MARKing method above will solve this problem too.

* Show the currently active connections from the connection tracker
  (like a network top). There are a few other tools for this, but ideally, our
  solution should show the active connections categorized according to firehol
  rules, not iptables rules.

* Documentation with the following sections:
	- Quick Start
	- Command Reference
	- Service Reference
	- Command Line Interface
	- Example Configurations
	- How to build your own firewall
	- Troubleshooting FireHOL
	- Control iptables Logging
	- Verify your firewall
		+ S/W tools
		+ Online Tools
	- a man page for firehol
	- a man page for firehol.conf

* A Web interface for configuring FireHOL.

* A secure mechanism for centralized control of a large number
  of Linux hosts and routers.

* A method for dynamic configuration of firehol, so that little changes would
  be applied without stopping and restarting the whole firewall.

* Protections should be able to applied to each firehol element
  individualy.

* Protections on interfaces should operate only when the firewall is going to
  allow the traffic.
  Now, protections operate on a per network interface basis, before the
  firewall rules, which means that an attacker could just produce a denial of
  service attack on http by SYN-FLOODing port 32000.
  Of course, the attacker can always SYN-FLOOD the http service to make the
  firewall drop temporarily all connections anyway.
  So, this ToDo item is more like a "should be the optimum way", without
  meaning that it is not right now.

* Support groups of services. Today, an interface or a router is much like
  a group. Ideally, we should also support subgroups that will allow the
  sharing of common protections and src/dst restriction and in the future
  common NAT and bandwidth shapping values.
