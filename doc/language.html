<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

FireHOL configuration files are normal <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a> scripts.
As such, you can use all <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a> features within FireHOL configuration
files, including functions, loops, variables, I/O, etc, etc.
<p>
I have chosen <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a> as the configuration language for FireHOL
since it is the common denominator for a language that all UNIX system administrators and developers
(or at least those that respect themselves) know and understand better.
<p>
The only <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a> features a FireHOL configuration script should never use, is <b>traps</b> and the <b>exit</b> command. Traps are used by FireHOL for cleaning
up all temporary files, and possibly restoring the previously running firewall in case FireHOL execution breaks, and the exit command will not just exit the configuration file, it will exit
FireHOL. FireHOL has disabled these features by default, so that you will not be able to use them, unless you specificaly enable them.
<p>
Also, since a FireHOL configuration script runs inline with FireHOL, all variables and function names defined within the
configuration file overwrite the ones defined by FireHOL. For this reason you should avoid using variables that start with
<b>FIREHOL_</b>, <b>work_</b>, <b>server_</b>, and <b>client_</b> as many such variables are used by FireHOL internally.
There are also a number of functions names you should avoid, but there is no generic pattern at the moment. I suggest you should
avoid defining functions with the names of FireHOL commands (interface, router, client, server, etc) and functions starting with <b>rules_</b>.
<p>
Note however that it is allowed to overwrite a few variables and functions if you want to modify FireHOL services (See the <a href="adding.html">Adding Services</a> section for more on this).
<p>
To learn <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a> scripting I suggest the following documents:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html">Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide</a> (updated)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html">BASH Programming - Introduction HOW-TO</a> (older)</li>
</ul>
