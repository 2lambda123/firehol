Page ordering for full manual (PDF/HTML) is in 0-index

To add a new file, just specify the output manpage near the top of Makefile
and add it to contents.md.

Use #, ##, ### rather than underlining titles, since some of the scripts
rely on them when combining files. The exception is introduction.md which
should use ====, ---- etc.

A comment block such as this will create extra outputs linking back to
the original manpage:
<!--
extra-manpage: firehol-accept.5
extra-manpage: firehol-reject.5
extra-manpage: firehol-drop.5
extra-manpage: firehol-deny.5
extra-manpage: firehol-return.5
extra-manpage: firehol-tarpit.5
-->

In order to make links across multiple formats as simple as possible,
follow these conventions:

Keywords + Services:
  Always write links to these as [your text][keyword-product-name]

  Keyword link definitions should be included in link-keywords-firehol
  or links-keywords-fireqos, and should be of the form:
     file.md#anchor-in-single-html
  the build scripts will take care of excluding or replacing the file.md
  according to the output format.

  Services links are generated automatically as part of the build process.

Internal Links:
  Always write links to these as [title name][] or if necessary as
  [your text][title name]

  Internal link definitions should be included in links-internal and
  written in the form 'filename.md#markdown-anchor' - these will be
  processed differently for each format.

External Links:
  External links can be written in-line as [whatever](http://host/path/#id)
  as they are not subject to special processing

Uniqueness of anchors:
  For the single-page HTML output, the anchors which are referenced must
  be globally unique, not just within a files. This means whenever an
  internal link is created, the section to which it refers must be
  uniquely named.

  The check-links script ensures this is the case whilst building the
  HTML output.

Vim Syntax highlighting, from here:

Add this to your .vimrc to get markdown formatting for .md files (rather
than the default Modula2):
   autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.markdown,*.md,*.mdown,*.mkd,*.mkdn
         \ if &ft =~# '^\%(conf\|modula2\)$' |
         \ set ft=markdown |
         \ else |
         \ setf markdown |
         \ endif
