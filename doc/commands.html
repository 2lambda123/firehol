	<a name="interface"><h3><b>interface</b> <font color="red">&lt;real interface&gt;</font> <font color="red">&lt;name&gt;</font> <b>[optional rule parameters]</b></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	The <b>interface</b> command creates a firewall for protecting the host the firewall is running, from the given interface.
	<br>The default interface policy is <b>drop</b>, so that if no subcommands are given, the
	firewall will just drop all incoming <b>and outgoing</b> traffic using this interface.
	<p>
	<H4>Parameters</H4>
	<ul>
		<li>	<b>real interface</b> is the interface name as shown by <b>ifconfig</b>.
			Generaly anything iptables accepts, including the pattern character + (the plus sign), is valid.
			<br>The plus sign after some text will match all interfaces that start with this text.
			<br>It is allowed to use more than one interfaces separated by spaces, but all of them should be
			given within one quoted argument:
			<br>Example: <b>interface "eth0 eth1 ppp0" myname</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>

		<li>	<b>name</b> is a name for this interface.
			<br>Generally you should use short names (10 characters max) without spaces or other symbols.
			<br>You should not use the same name more than once in FireHOL primary commands.
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>
			
		<li>	<b>optional rule parameters</b> is a set of rules that allow further restriction of the traffic that
			gets matched for this interface. See <a href="#parameters">Optional Rules Parameters</a> for more information.
			<br>Example 1: <b>interface eth0 intranet src 10.0.0.0/16</b>
			<br>Example 2: <b>interface eth0 internet src not "$UNROUTABLE_IPS"</b>
			(note: UNROUTABLE_IPS is a variable defined by FireHOL that includes all IPs that should not be routable
			by the Internet).
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>
		</ul>
	<p>

<hr noshade size=1 width="70%">

	<a name="router"><h3><b>router</b> <font color="red">&lt;name&gt;</font> <b>[optional rule parameters]</b></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	The <b>router</b> command creates a firewall for the traffic passing through the host running the firewall.
	The only acceptable policy on all <b>router</b> commands is <b>return</b> and therefore the policy subcommand
	cannot be used on routers. This means that no packets are dropped in a router. Packets not matched by any
	<b>router</b> command will be dropped at the end of the firewall.
	<p>
	<H4>Parameters</H4>
	<ul>
		<li>	<b>name</b> is a name for this router.
			<br>The same restrictions of <b>interface</b> names apply here too.
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>
			
		<li>	<b>optional rule parameters</b> is a set of rules that allow further restriction of the traffic that
			gets matched for this router. See <a href="#parameters">Optional Rules Parameters</a> for more information.
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>
		</ul>
	
	Router statements produce similar iptables commands the interface statements produce.
	For each router statement an <b>in_<font color="red">&lt;name&gt;</font></b> and an
	<b>out_<font color="red">&lt;name&gt;</font></b> chain are produced to match the traffic
	in both directions of the router.
	<br>
	To match some client or server traffic the administrator has to specify the input/output
	interface or the source/destination of the request.
	All inface/outface, src/dst optional rule paramaters can be given either on the <b>router</b>
	statement in which case will be applied to all subcommands for this <i>router</i>,
	or on each subcommand within a <b>router</b>.
	Both are valid.
	<br>
	For example:
	<pre>
		router mylan inface ppp+ outface eth0
			server http accept
			client smtp accept
	</pre>
	The above says: Define a router that matches all <u>requests</u> that originate from some PPP interface and go out to eth0.<br>
	There is an HTTP server in eth0 that client from the PPP interfaces are allowed to reach.<br>
	Clients on eth0 are allowed to get SMTP traffic from the PPP interfaces.<br>
	<br>
	While:
	<pre>
		router mylan
			server http accept inface ppp+ outface eth0
			server smtp accept inface eth0 outface ppp+
	</pre>
	The above says: Define a router that matches any kind of forwarded traffic.<br>
	For HTTP traffic the clients are on a PPP interface and the servers on eth0.<br>
	For SMTP traffic the clients are on a eth0 interface and the servers o a PPP interface.
	<p>
	Please note that in the second example the SMTP traffic is matched again with a <b>server</b> subcommand,
	not a <b>client</b> (as in the first example).
	<p>
	The <b>client</b> subcommand <u>reverses</u> all the optional rules that are applied <u>indirectly</u> to it.
	Indirect rule parameters are those that are inherited from the parent command (<b>router</b> in this case).
	<br>
	To make it simple, for FireHOL a <b>client</b> is: "a <b>server</b> with all the implicit optional rule parameters reversed".
	<p>
	So, in the first example, the <b>client</b> simply flipped the inface and outface rules defined at the <b>router</b>
	and became an SMTP <b>server</b>.
	<br>In the second example there is nothing to be flipped, so <b>server</b> and <b>client</b>
	are exactly the same.<p>
	I suggest to use <b>client</b> subcommands in routers only if you have inface/outface or src/dst in the <b>router</b> statements.
	If you are building routers like the second example, don't use <b>client</b>, it is confusing.
	<p>
	Older versions of FireHOL did not allow server and client subcommands in routers.
	Only the <b>route</b> subcommand was allowed. Today, <b>route</b> is just an alias for <b>server</b> and can be
	used only in routers, not interfaces.
	<p>
	Any number of <b>router</b> statements can exist. Since the policy is RETURN on all of them, any traffic
	not matched by a <i>router</i> will continue to be checked against the second.
	<p>

<hr noshade size=1 width="70%">

	<a name="version"><h3><b>version</b> <font color="red">&lt;number&gt;</font></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	The <b>version</b> command states the FireHOL <u>release</u> the configuration file was
	created for. In case the configuration file is newer than FireHOL, FireHOL will deny
	to run it.
	<p>
	This command is here to allow you or anyone else design and distribute FireHOL configuration files, while
	ensuring that the correct FireHOL version is going to run them.
	<p>
	Since FireHOL configurations are BASH script, it is relatively easy to use FireHOL configurations as small
	scripts that dynamically process rules stored in a database, in a filesystem as separate files, or elsewhere.
	This directive will help the developers of FireHOL configurations to control the required version of
	FireHOL.
	<p>
	The FireHOL release is increased every time the format of the configuration file and the internals of FireHOL are changed.
	<p>
	
<hr noshade size=1 width="70%">

	<a name="iptables"><h3><b>iptables</b> <font color="red">&lt;arguments&gt;</font></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	The <b>iptables</b> command passes all its arguments to the real iptables command, during run-time.
	<p>
	You should not use in FireHOL configurations <b>/sbin/iptables</b> or other means to alter a FireHOL firewall.
	If you do, your commands will be run <u>before</u> FireHOL activates its firewall and while the <u>previous</u>
	firewall is still running. Also, since FireHOL will delete all <u>previous</u> firewall rules in order to
	activate the new firewall, any changes you will make, will be deleted too.
	<p>
	Always use the <b>iptables</b> directive to hook iptables commands in a FireHOL firewall. Nothing else.
	<p>

<hr noshade size=1 width="70%">
<center><a name="subcommands"><h2>Sub-Commands</h2></a></center>

	<a name="policy"><h3><b>policy</b> <font color="red">&lt;action&gt;</font></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	The <b>policy</b> subcommand defines the default policy for an <b>interface</b>.
	<p>
	This directive accepts all the actions iptables accepts, i.e. DROP, REJECT, ACCEPT,
	RETURN, etc.
	Note that there is no meaning to use the LOG action, since FireHOL accepts it as an
	optional rule parameter (see bellow).
	<p>
	The policy of routers cannot be changed and is always RETURN.
	<p>

<hr noshade size=1 width="70%">

	<a name="protection"><h3><b>protection</b> [reverse] <font color="red">&lt;type&gt;</font> [requests/sec [burst]]</h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	The <b>protection</b> subcommand sets a number of protection rules on an <b>interface</b>.
	<p>
	In router configurations, <b>protections</b> are setup on <b>inface</b>. The <b>reverse</b> keyword will make the
	protections setup on <b>outface</b>.
	<p>
	<b>type</b> can be: <br>
	<ul><b>strong</b>, or <b>full</b>, or <b>all</b>
	<br>turns on all the possible protections.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>fragments</b>
	<br>Drops all packet fragments. Please note that most probably this rule will never match anything since
	iptables reconstracts all packets automatically, before the iptables firewall rules are processed, when its connection tracker is running.
	<br>I left this here for psychological reasons and in case some one finds some use for it.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>new-tcp-w/o-syn</b>
	<br>Drops all TCP packets that initiate a socket but have no the SYN bit set.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>syn-floods</b>
	<br>Allows only a certain amount of new TCP connections per second. The optional two arguments [requests/sec] and [burst]
	are used by this rule in order to provide control on the number of connections to be allowed.
	The default is 100 connections per second that can be bursted by 4.
	<br>Note that this rule applies to all connections attempted regardless of their final result (rejected, dropped, established, etc).
	Therefore it might not be a good idea to set it too low.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>icmp-floods</b>
	<br>Allows only a certain amount of ICMP echo requests per second. The optional two arguments [requests/sec] and [burst]
	are used by this rule in order to provide control on the number of connections to be allowed.
	The default is 100 connections per second that can be bursted by 4.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>malformed-xmas</b>
	<br>Drops all TCP packets that have all the TCP flags set.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>malformed-null</b>
	<br>Drops all TCP packets that have all the TCP flags unset.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>malformed-bad</b>
	<br>Drops all TCP packets that have illegal combinations of TCP flags set.
	</ul>
	<p>

	<a name="server"><h3><b>server</b> <font color="red">&lt;service&gt;</font> <font color="red">&lt;action&gt;</font> [optional rule parameters]</h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	The <b>server</b> subcommand defines a server of a service. For FireHOL a server is the destination of a request,
	and even if this is more complex for multi-socket services, <u>for FireHOL a server always accepts requests</u>.
	<br>This subcommand can be used on both interfaces and routers.
	<p>
	<H4>Parameters</H4>
	<ul>
		<li>	<b>service</b> is one of the supported service names.
			<br>The command accepts more than one services in the same argument if they are separated by space
			and quoted as a single argument.
			<br>Example 1: <b>server smtp accept</b>
			<br>Example 2: <b>server "smtp pop3 imap" accept</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>

		<li>	<b>action</b> tells FireHOL what to do with the traffic matching this rule.
			<p>FireHOL supports the following actions:
			<br><b>accept</b>, to allow the traffic reach its destination.
			<br><b>reject</b>, to reject this traffic by sending back an ICMP destination port unreachable message.
			<br><b>drop</b>, to silently (for the sender) discard the traffic.
			<br>Please note that although FireHOL supports all other possible iptables actions, I suggest not to
			use them since FireHOL has not been tested with them.
			<br>Note also that the <b>log</b> iptables action is a FireHOL optional rule parameter and it is not
			required to be used as an action.
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>
			
		<li>	<b>optional rule parameters</b> is a set of rules that allow further restriction of the traffic that
			gets matched by this rule. See <a href="#parameters">Optional Rules Parameters</a> for more information.
			<br>Example 1: <b>server smtp accept src 1.2.3.4</b>
			<br>Example 2: <b>server smtp accept log "its mail" src 1.2.3.4</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>
		</ul>

	<a name="client"><h3><b>client</b> <font color="red">&lt;service&gt;</font> <font color="red">&lt;action&gt;</font> [optional rule parameters]</h3></a>
	The <b>client</b> subcommand defines a client of a service. For FireHOL a client is the source of a request.
	FireHOL follows this simple rule even on multi-socket complex protocols, so that <u>for FireHOL a client always sends requests</u>.
	<br>The parameters are exactly the same with the <b>server</b> subcommand.
	<br>This subcommand can be used on both interfaces and routers.
	<p>

<hr noshade size=1 width="70%">
	
	<a name="route"><h3><b>route</b> <font color="red">&lt;service&gt;</font> <font color="red">&lt;action&gt;</font> [optional rule parameters]</h3></a>
	The <b>route</b> subcommand is an alias for the <b>server</b> command. It can be used only on routers, not interfaces.
	<p>

<hr noshade size=1 width="70%">
	
	<a name="masquerade"><h3><b>masquerade</b> [reverse | interface]</h3></a>
	The <b>masquerade</b> subcommand will setup masquerading on the outface of the parent primary command.
	<br>If reverse is specified it will masquerade on the input interface of the parent primary command.
	<br>If an interface is specified, masquerade will use this one.
	<p>
	This command can be used everywhere: within interfaces and routers but also as primary command (in which case the interface argument is required).
	<p>

<a name="parameters"><center><h2>Optional Rule Parameters</h2></center></a>

	<a name="src"><h3><b>src</b> [not] <font color="red">&lt;host&gt;</font></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	<b>src</b> defines the source IP address of the <u>REQUEST</u>. If <b>src</b> is defined on a <b>server</b> statement it matches the
	source of the request which is the remote host, while if it is defined on a <b>client</b> statement it matches <u>again</u>
	the source of the request, but this time it is the local host. <b>Focus on the REQUEST!!!</b> Forget the reply.
	<p>
	<H4>Parameters</H4>
	<ul>
		<li>	<b>not</b> is an optional argument that reverses the match. When defined, the rule will match all hosts
			except the ones defined.
			<br>Example: <b>server smtp accept src not 1.2.3.4</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>

		<li>	<b>host</b> can be an IP address, a hostname, or a subnet.
			<br>Multiple hosts/networks can be defined if separated by space and quoted as a single argument.
			<br>Example 1: <b>server smtp accept src 1.2.3.4</b>

	<a name="dst"><h3><b>dst</b> [not] <font color="red">&lt;host&gt;</font></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	<b>dst</b> defines the destination of the <u>REQUEST</u>. If <b>dst</b> is defined on a <b>server</b> statement it matches the
	destination of the request which is the local host, while if it is defined on a <b>client</b> statement it matches <u>again</u>
	the destination of the request, but this time it is the remote host. <b>Focus on the REQUEST!!!</b> Forget the reply.

	<b>inface</b> cannot be used in <b>interface</b> commands.
	<p>
	<H4>Parameters</H4>
	<ul>
		<li>	<b>not</b> is an optional argument that reverses the match. When defined, the rule will match all interfaces
			except the ones defined.
			<br>Example: <b>server smtp accept inface not eth0</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>

		<li>	<b>interface</b> if an interface name in the same format the <b>interface</b> command accepts.

	<p>It is required to quote all the parameters given to <b>custom</b>. If the parameters include a space character
	between some text that is required to be given to iptables as one argument, it is required to escape another set of
	quotes in order. Another way is to use double quotes externally and single quotes internally.
	<br>
	<br>Example 1: <b>server smtp accept custom "--some-iptables-option and_its_value"</b>

	DEFAULT_INTERFACE_POLICY controls the default action to be taken on traffic not matched by any rule within an interface.
	The value of DEFAULT_INTERFACE_POLICY is passed as is to iptables, so use capitals. Be carefull not to accept the traffic
	not matched by any rule, as it will break your firewall. It is however safe enough to use RETURN here (but see bellow
