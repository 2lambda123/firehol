FireHOL has been designed to be:
<ul>
	<li><b>secure</b> (as this is the most important factor for a firewall)</li>
	<li>completely <b>dynamic</b> (to allow you do whatever you like)</li>
	<li>extremely <b>simple</b> to configure, understand, audit, use and alter.</li>
</ul>
<p>
FireHOL has been designed to be a firewall for... <b>humans</b>!
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

FireHOL is extremely simple. Take a look at this configuration:


<center><table border=0 cellpadding=15 cellspacing=20 width="70%">
<tr><td bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
<b><pre>
	version 5
	
	interface eth0 internet
		server smtp accept
		client dns accept
	  
	interface eth1 mailout
		client smtp accept
</pre></b>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

The above state that a mail server is run on this Linux server which listens on eth0, DNS are resolved via eth0
and mails are send via eth1. Nothing else will be allowed. The server will be unpingable, no one will be able to
login via SSH or other means, and even from its keyboard and monitor, no one will be able to do anything else than
DNS queries via eth0 and SMTP to remote mailers via eth1!
<p>
FireHOL is <b>secure</b> because it has been designed with the right firewalling concept: <b>deny everything, then allow only what is
needed</b>. FireHOL is secure because it produces <b>stateful</b> iptables packet filtering
firewalls (and possibly, the only generic tool today that does that). Stateful, means that you can have control based on who initiated the traffic. For example: you can choose to be able to
ping anyone on the internet, but no one to be able to ping you.
<br>
If for example you don't need to run a server on your Linux host, you can easily achieve a situation where you are
able to do anything to anyone, but as far as the rest of world is concerned, <b>you do not exist</b>!
<p>
FireHOL is completely <b>dynamic</b>, since with its <a href="language.html">language</a> you can describe any firewall
configuration you wish using simple <a href="commands.html">commands</a>.
<p>
This example is a router for a home lan:

<center><table border=0 cellpadding=15 cellspacing=20 width="70%">
<tr><td bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
<b><pre>
	version 5
	
	interface eth0 home
		policy accept
	
	interface ppp+ internet
		client all accept
	
	router myclients inface eth0 outface ppp+
		masquerade
		route all accept
</pre></b>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

The above will only allow:
	<ul>
	<li>eth0: anything to be received and send</li>
	<li>ppp+: Any kind of requests to be send and their replies to be received</li>
	<li>routing client requests coming in from eth0 and going out to ppp+ and their matching replies in the opposite direction, using masquerading.</li>
	</ul>
<p>

<tr><td bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><b>Why?</td></tr></table>
<br>
As an IT executive, responsible for many dozens of Linux systems, I 
needed a firewalling solution that would allow me and my team to have a 
clear and simple view of what is happening on each server, as far as 
firewalling is concerned. I also needed a solution that will allow my 
team members to produce high quality and homogeneous firewalls 
independently of their security skills and knowledge. After searching 
for such a tool, I quickly concluded that no tool is flexible, open, 
easy, and simple enough for what I needed.</p>
<p>I decided to write FireHOL in a way that will allow me, or anyone 
else, to view, verify and audit the firewall of any linux server or 
linux router <b>in seconds</b>. FireHOL's configuration is extremely 
simple... you don't have to be an expert to design a complicated but 
secure firewall.

<p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0 width="100%">
<tr><td bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><b>What features does it have?</td></tr></table>
<br>
FireHOL handles firewalls protecting one host on all its interfaces 
and any combination of stateful firewalls routing traffic from one 
interface to another. There are no limitations on the number of 
interfaces or on the number of routing routes (except the ones iptables 
has, if any).
<p>FireHOL, still lacks a few features: SNAT and DNAT are not supported. 
PREROUTING and MANGLING are not supported either. QoS, although not 
iptables stuff, is missing too. You are welcome to extend FireHOL and 
send me your patches to integrate within FireHOL.</p>

<p>Note however that you can embed normal iptables commands in a FireHOL 
configuration script for NATing, REDIRECTing ports, etc.</p>

<p>
Since FireHOL produces stateful commands, for every supported service 
it needs to know the flow of requests and replies. Today FireHOL 
supports the following services:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many single socket protocols, such as HTTP, NNTP, SMTP, POP3, 
  IMAP4, RADIUS, SSH, LDAP, MySQL, Telnet, NTP, DNS, etc.
  There are a few dozens of such services defined in FireHOL. Check <a href="services.html">this list.</a>
  Even if something is missing, you can <a href="adding.html">define it</a>.<br>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Many complex protocols, such as FTP, NFS, SAMBA, PPTP, etc. 
  If you need some complex protocol that is not present, you will have 
  to program it (in simple BASH scripting - there are many commented 
  examples on how this is done). Again, you will just create one BASH 
  function with the rules of the protocol, and FireHOL will turn it to
  a client, a server or a router.</li>
</ul>
