FireHOL has been designed to be:
<ul>
	<li>first of all, <b>secure</b> (as this is the most important factor for a firewall)</li>
	<li>completely <b>dynamic</b> (to allow you do whatever you like)</li>
	<li>extremely <b>simple</b> to configure, understand, audit, use and alter.</li>
</ul>
<p>
FireHOL has been designed to be a firewall for... <b>humans</b>!

<h3>Example Configuration</h3>
<b>Rules for a simple SMTP relay server</b>, with two ethernet interfaces, where SMTP traffic is
received from clients via eth0 and send to other SMTP servers via eth1:

<pre>
	version 5
	
	interface eth0 mailin
		server smtp accept
		client dns accept
	  
	interface eth1 mailout
		client smtp accept
	
</pre>
The above will only allow:
	<ul>
	<li>eth0: SMTP requests to be received</li>
	<li>eth0: SMTP replies (matching the requests) to be send</li>
	<li>eth0: DNS requests to be send</li>
	<li>eth0: DNS replies (matching the requests) to be received</li>
	<li>eth1: SMTP requests to be send</li>
	<li>eth1: SMTP replies (matching the requests) to be received</li>
	</ul>
<p>
<b>Nothing else will be allowed!</b> The server will be unpingable, you will not be able to login via SSH,
and even from its console you will not be able to request anything except DNS via eth0 and SMTP via eth1!

<p>
<b>Rules for a simple router</b> for a home LAN:

<pre>
	version 5
	
	interface eth0 home
		policy accept
	
	interface ppp+ internet
		client all accept
	
	router myclients inface eth0 outface ppp+
		masquerade
		route all accept

</pre>
The above will only allow:
	<ul>
	<li>eth0: anything to be received and send</li>
	<li>ppp+: Any kind of requests to be send and their replies to be received</li>
	<li>routing client requests coming in from eth0 and going out to ppp+ and their matching replies in the opposite direction, using masquerading.</li>
	</ul>


<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>As an IT executive, responsible for many dozens of Linux systems, I 
needed a firewalling solution that would allow me and my team to have a 
clear and simple view of what is happening on each server, as far as 
firewalling is concerned. I also needed a solution that will allow my 
team members to produce high quality and homogeneous firewalls 
independently of their security skills and knowledge. After searching 
for such a tool, I quickly concluded that no tool is flexible, open, 
easy, and simple enough for what I needed.</p>
<p>I decided to write FireHOL in a way that will allow me, or anyone 
else, to view, verify and audit the firewall of any linux server or 
linux router <b>in seconds</b>. FireHOL's configuration is extremely 
simple... you don't have to be an expert to design a complicated but 
secure firewall.</p>

<h3>Is it secure enough?</h3>
<p>FireHOL has been designed with the &quot;right firewalling concept&quot;: <b>
deny everything, then allow only what is needed</b>. This means that an 
empty configuration file (yes, this is allowed: only the <i>version</i> 
command is mandatory) will just drop all packets, on all interfaces 
(except, of course, the loopback device) and will not route anything 
from/to any interfaces.</p>
<p>It is however important to know that no guarantee can be given for 
its level of security or that it will eventually prevent any kind of 
damage or attack on your system(s). This program is just a &quot;code 
generator&quot;, not a firewall: It parses a configuration file and produces 
iptables commands. You are supposed to at least audit once the generated 
iptables commands for each service (smtp, ssh, etc) until <b>you</b> 
believe the rules I have placed there are secure enough for you. For 
sure, I admit that this is not a mature product (yet) and I may have 
made mistakes...</p>

<h3>What type of firewall it produces?</h3>
<p>FireHOL produces stateful packet-filtering rules for iptables, even 
on UDP and ICMP. This means that all traffic is allowed only if it 
matches <i>server</i> or <i>client</i> requests defined in the 
configuration file, and of course their matching replies or related 
sockets.</p>

<h3>What features does it have?</h3>
<p>FireHOL handles firewalls protecting one host on all its interfaces 
and any combination of stateful firewalls routing traffic from one 
interface to another. There are no limitations on the number of 
interfaces or on the number of routing routes (except the ones iptables 
has, if any).</p>
<p>FireHOL, still lacks a few features: SNAT and DNAT are not supported. 
PREROUTING and MANGLING are not supported either. QoS, although not 
iptables stuff, is missing too. You are welcome to extend FireHOL and 
send me your patches to integrate within FireHOL.</p>
<p>Note however that you can embed normal iptables commands in a FireHOL 
configuration script for NATing, REDIRECTing ports, etc.</p>
<p>Since FireHOL produces stateful commands, for every supported service 
it needs to know the flow of requests and replies. Today FireHOL 
supports the following services:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All single socket protocols, such as HTTP, NNTP, SMTP, POP3, 
  IMAP4, RADIUS, SSH, LDAP, MySQL, Telnet, NTP, DNS, etc.
  There are a few dozens of such services defined in FireHOL.
  Even if something is missing, you can define it (in the configuration
  file or FireHOL itself - see bellow).<br>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Many complex protocols, such as FTP, NFS, SAMBA, DHCP, PPTP, etc. 
  If you need some complex protocol that is not present, you will have 
  to program it (in simple BASH scripting - there are many commented 
  examples on how this is done). Again, you will just create one BASH 
  function with the rules of the protocol, and FireHOL will turn it to
  <i>client</i>, <i>server</i> and <i>route</i> commands.</li>
</ul>
