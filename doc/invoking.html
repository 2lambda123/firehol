FireHOL has been designed to be a startup service. As such, FireHOL accepts all the command line arguments
/etc/init.d/iptables plus a few more. Bellow is a list of the currently supported command line arguments:
<p>
<center>
<table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=5 width="70%">
<tr><th bgcolor="#000000"><font color="white">Parameter</th><th bgcolor="#000000"><font color="white">Description</th></tr>
<tr>	<td><b>start</td>
	<td>	Activates the firewall configuration.
		<br>The configuration is expected to be found in <b>/etc/firehol.conf</b>
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><b>try</td>
	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">	Activates the firewall, but waits until
		the user types the word <b>commit</b>. If this word
		is not typed within 30 seconds, the previous
		firewall is restored.
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td><b>stop</td>
	<td>	Stops a running iptables firewall by running <b>/etc/init.d/iptables stop</b>.
		This will allow all traffic to pass unchecked.
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><b>restart</td>
	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">	this is an alias for <b>start</b> and is given for
		compatibility with <b>/etc/init.d/iptables</b>.
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td><b>condrestart</td>
	<td>	Starts the FireHOL firewall only if it is not
		already active. It does not detect a modified
		configuration file, only verifies that FireHOL has been started
		in the past and not stopped yet.
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><b>status</td>
	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">	Shows the running firewall, as in
		<b>/sbin/iptables -nxvL | less</b>
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td><b>panic</td>
	<td>	Executes <b>/etc/init.d/iptables panic</b>
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><b>save</td>
	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">	Start the firewall and then saves it using
		<b>/etc/init.d/iptables save</b>
		<p>
		Note that not all FireHOL firewalls will work if
		restored with: <b>/etc/init.d/iptables start</b>
		because FireHOL handles kernel modules and might have queried
		RPC servers (used by the NFS service) before starting the firewall.
		Also, FireHOL automatically checks current kernel configuration for
		client ports range. If you restore a firewall using the iptables service
		your firewall may not work as expected.
		
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td><b>debug</td>
	<td>	Parses the configuration file but instead of
		activating it, it shows the generated iptables
		statements.
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><b>&lt;a&nbsp;filename&gt;</td>
	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">	a different configuration file.
		If no other argument is given, the configuration
		file will be "tried" (default = try).
		Otherwise the argument next to the filename can
		be one of the above (start, restart, debug, etc).

<H2>How FireHOL runs?</H2>
FireHOL is a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a> script.
To run its configuration file, FireHOL
first defines a set of functions and variables and then it &quot;sources&quot; 
(runs inline) its configuration file to be executed by <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a>.</p>
<p>
The keywords <i>interface</i>, <i>client</i>, <i>server</i>, <i>
router</i>, etc. are all <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a> functions that are executed by <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a> when 
and if they appear in the configuration file. Using shared variables 
these functions share some state information that allows them to know, 
for example, that a <i>client</i> command appears within an <i>interface</i> 
and not within a <i>router</i> and that the name given to an <i>
interface</i> has not been used before.
<p>
Instead of running iptables commands directly, each of these 
functions (i.e. FireHOL) just writes the generated iptables commands to 
a temporary file. This is done to prevent altering a running firewall 
before ensuring that the syntax of the configuration file is correct. 
So, a complete run of the configuration file actually produces all the 
iptables commands for the firewall, written to a temporary file 
(script).&nbsp; Even the <i>iptables</i> commands given within the 
configuration file use the same concept (they just generate iptables 
commands in this script).
<p>
Finally, this script (the generated iptables commands) has to be run, 
but before doing so, FireHOL saves the running firewall to another 
temporary file. The saved firewall will be automatically restored if 
some of the generated iptables commands produces an error.
Such an error 
is possible when for example, you specify an invalid IP address or 
hostname, or an invalid argument to some&nbsp; parameter that gets passed to 
iptables as-is.
<p>
It is important to understand that <b>during the run of the generated 
iptables script (including the possible restoration of the old 
firewall), FireHOL allows all traffic to reach its destination</b>. This 
has been done to prevent a possible lock-out situation where you are 
SSHing to the server to alter its firewall, and suddenly you loose the 
connection (although this can still happen if your new firewall doesn't 
allow the connection).
<p>
If no error has been seen, FireHOL deletes all temporary files 
generated and exits.
<p>
In case there was an error, FireHOL will make the most to restore 
your previous firewall and will present you details about the error and 
its line number in the original configuration file.
