                            Packaging Scripts
                            *****************

check-log:
   Checks the formatting of ChangeLog meets the debian packaging
   standards.

pre-commit:
   Copy to .git/hooks/pre-commit in order to have check-log and
   any other style checks automatically run on commit

packver:
   Emits the package version using the same logic as the firehol
   and fireqos scripts - used by the autoconf system to determine
   the version number to put in documentation (and to check in NEWS
   when doing a make dist).
