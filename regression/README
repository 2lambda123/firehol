                         FireHOL Regression Tests
                         ************************

WARNING: your firewall is cleared out before starting and after finishing
and will go through a number or arbitrary states. DO NOT RUN these tests
unless you are protected by a firewall elsewhere on your network.

Run tests as:
  sudo ./regress -ok versions...

e.g.:
  sudo ./regress -ok current v1.296 v2.0.0-pre3

To get comparisons between the current firehol.in in the working
directory (including edits) and tagged versions 1.296 and 2.0.0-pre3

Any number of versions may be specified.

Any .conf files under the tests directory will be run one by one for each
version.

Output goes into output/<version> directories - old data will be removed
before the new tests are run:
  output/<version>/*.log             - stdout+stderr from run
  output/<version>/*.out             - iptables-save output
  output/<version>/ipv4-no-nat/*.out - iptables-save output with nat removed
  output/<version>/ipv6/*.out        - ip6tables-save output

Output is slightly munged to minimise the differences between runs and
between iptables-save and ip6tables-save output. See tools/run-suite.sh
for the details.


Comparison examples
===================
Compare current edited version to last v1.x release behaviour:
  diff -r output/v.1296 output/current

Compare current master version to last v1.x release behaviour:
  diff -r output/master output/current

Compare IPv4 only to FireHOL with IPv6 behaviour:
  diff output/v2.0.0-pre3 output/v2.0.0
(no point in comparing subdirectories since IPv6 is different by definition)

Compare IPv4 output to FireHOL IPv6 output in both-capable version:
  diff output/v2.0.0/ipv4-no-nat output/v2.0.0/ipv6

Compare IPv4 to IPv6 in current edit
  diff output/current/ipv4-no-nat output/current/ipv6

Compare effect of activation policy on final firewall:
  diff output/current/tests-activation-policy-default.out \
       output/current/tests-activation-policy-accept.out

  diff output/current/tests-activation-policy-default.out \
       output/current/tests-activation-policy-drop.out

and so forth.


Writing new test configurations
===============================
Take a look at this file:
  tests/domain-names/ipv6-if-available.conf

It is written in such a way as to allow for being run by FireHOL with
or without IPv6 capability (i.e. post or pre 2.0.0).


Auditing and signing test configurations
========================================
When the iptables output of a configuration is known to be good it
can be appended to the configuration file and gpg-signed using the
"sigtool" program.

Multiple signatures can be accumulated to give extra confidence
regarding the validity of output. If you understand iptables well
but do not program, creating sample configurations, auditing and
signing them is a great way to contribute.

The audited output is attached to the configuration file but enclosed
within bash functions so that FireHOL does not attempt to executed it.
The functions have specific names to allow the output to be extracted
for comparison later. The following two functions are used:

audit_results_ipv4() {
# iptables-save output goes here after processing with tools/reorg-save
}

audit_results_ipv6() {
# ip6tables-save output goes here after processing with tools/reorg-save
}

An additional audit function may be provided which can test the output
status and logfile contents. This is especially useful for tests that
are expected to fail for some reason. The following script can be used
to check for a successful load of the firewall:

audit_results_script() {
  local tmpdir="${1}"
  local status="${2}"
  local logfile="${3}"
  shift; shift; shift;

  local expected_status=0
  if [ $status -ne $expected_status ]
  then
    echo "Unexpected status $status (expected $expected_status)"
    return 1
  fi

  tail -n 1 "${logfile}" > $tmpdir/$$.log || return 1
  if ! grep -q "^Activating new firewall ([0-9]* rules): OK$" $tmpdir/$$.log
  then
    echo "Log did not end as expected (with firewall activation)"
    return 1
  fi
  return 0
}

To first sign a configuration, run:
  ./sigtool tests/..../test.conf <gpgid> <verno>

Where <gpgid> is a string that gpg will recognise for the purpose of
selecting your gpg key and <verno> is the version of the output that
has been audited as correct for the test in question.

The sigtool will append the iptables-save output to the configuration
file tests/..../test.conf in a way that the regression suite will
remove it before running and automatically compare the output. Please
send this updated file along with the new tests/..../test.sigs file
to the mailing list.

To add a signature to a configuration that has already been audited, run:
  ./sigtool tests/..../test.conf <gpgid>
and just send the updated sigs file to the mailing list.

Note that there can only ever be a single audited output. It is not
unthinkable that changes in future will mean that a different output
could achieve identical aims... if this happens the suite will need
to be updated to cope.

The regression tool will automatically list the signatures on a test
or you can run:
  ./sigtool tests/..../test.conf


Recommended services for testing with
=====================================
All services fall into one of these criteria:
   simple - single UDP port
   simple - single TCP port
   simple - multiple ports
  complex - multiple ports

Whilst technically all complex services are unique, these four services
give a good broad coverage of overall behaviour:
     tftp - udp 69
      ssh - tcp 22
  eserver - tcp/4661 udp/4661 udp/4665
  hylafax - server listens on tcp/4559 + opens back to client tcp/4558
