  * Move to autotools
    - Can still be installed just by copying firehol/firehol.in
    - CVS versions will not work any longer, so now following
      http://semver.org/
    - Git commit hooks included to enforce version numbering
      across the various files, NEWS, ChangeLog, configure.ac and 
      sbin/firehol.in
    - Replace HTML website copy with DocBook manual
