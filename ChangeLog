firehol (3.0.0-rc.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Common
    - ipset fixes
    - require pandoc 1.12.2.1 and use its features
    - iprove contents page in documentation

  * FireHOL updates
    - made STOP mode exit successfully
    - add support for restore when specifying a filename on the command line
    - allow multiple "except" rules in statements that accept the keyword
    - disabled spinner in explain mode
    - add support for comma as an ipset IP separator
    - tproxy now uses markdef() to allocate a mark
    - save marks.conf only after successful firewall activation
    - drop requirement for awk (other programs still use it)
    - add log() and loglimit() helpers to allow logging from ipsets globally
    - prevented backup of all the ipsets in memory - it takes too long
      when the system has many ipsets installed
    - rewrote the ipsets functionality so that:s
      - it optimizes netsets with iprange if present
      - it adapts the maxelem parameter for the updated ipset so that
        updating ipsets with big incremental updates does not fail
      - maintains compatibility with older ipset versions
        (side-effect: calling an ipset update without restarting the
         firewall now only support ipsets that are used in firehol.conf)
      - if iprange is present, processing of ipsets is a lot faster

  * FireQOS updates
    - add ability to stop QoS on a specific device
    - fix for ERROR columns on some tc versions
    - max/ceil % is now relative to parent's ceiling rate
      (it was by mistake to parent's base rate)
    - warn if a class takes priority outside the valid ranges of HTB (0-7)
    - switched default color from blue to green

  * Link-Balancer updates
    - add wrappers for rawmark() and custommark()
    - when a table was already up to date but other depend on it,
      it was failing #78
    - fix issue when specifying loop and timeout #77

  * Contrib (ipsets scripts)
    - various fixes and lists added
    - support aggregate to optimize netsets
    - support syslog logging
    - add iprange program, various enhancements over original

  * VNetBuild updates
    - Added
