firehol (2.0.0-pre4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleanups and minor improvements
    - Remove the blank line from wizard/helpme output
    - Remove the #! from wizard output - it cannot be executed directly
    - Cleaned up boilerplace information in script
    - "firehol condrestart" now follows official conventions by restarting
       only if already running

  * Fix kernel version detection so that it is more flexible and
    less error prone.

  * Allow switching on of debug output by setting environment variable
    FIREHOL_DEBUGGING to a non-empty value.

  * Fix "mac" helper command so that it works with iptables 1.4.12+
    - Previous behaviour was deprecated in 1.4.3 (Jul 2009)
    - Also prevent mac addresses being seen as IPv6 addresses

  * Allow some config variables to be set as environment variables
    - FIREHOL_ESTABLISHED_ACTIVATION_ACCEPT,
      FIREHOL_INPUT_ACTIVATION_POLICY, FIREHOL_FORWARD_ACTIVATION_POLICY,
      FIREHOL_OUTPUT_ACTIVATION_POLICY, FIREHOL_LOAD_KERNEL_MODULES,
      FIREHOL_NAT, FIREHOL_ROUTING, FIREHOL_AUTOSAVE

  * Do not try to add DROP rules to NAT chains
    - See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=536675

  * Use "ss" in place of "netstat"
    - As suggested here https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=784520
